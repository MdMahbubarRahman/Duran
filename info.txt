This branch offers extra functionality in solving mixed integer 
linear problem while running the outer approximation algorithm. 
Specially we try to implement pricing algorithm which is the combination of 
branch and bound, and  dantzig-wolfe decomposition
or column generation to solve our special structured 
milp problem.
