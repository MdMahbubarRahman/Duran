We are going to implement pricing algoirthm. The abstract idea is:
1. implement branch and bound algorithm
2. in each node of the branch and bound algorithm solve lp model using column generation algorithm


For column generation:
   a) create a function which would take a lp model as argument and solve the lp using column generation algorithm and return solution of the model
   b) create a function to decomposte lp model and generate master problem and pricing subproblem(s) 


For branch and bound:
   a) generate functions for different branching strategies
   b) generate options for different search strategies
   c) generate functions for different node selection strategies

For pricing algorithm:
   Combine branch and bound and column generation algorithm in such a way that it can efficiently solve mixed integer linear programming problem.
